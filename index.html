        <h2>Tell the Mayor and your councillor we need a fully funded Infill Strategy</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
      The Residential Infill Strategy is a major policy framework that could guide development for decades.
      </p>


      <p>
      It's a big deal, folks.
      </p>

      <p>
      The City, however, isn't committing the funds to do it properly. They're doing consultations on a shoestring budget. Your voice won't be heard.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most important thing you can do is <strong><a href="/my-councillor.html">CONTACT YOUR COUNCILLOR</a> AND MAYOR BOWMAN</strong>. Tell them the infill strategy needs the full, $650k budget to hold high quality consultations.
      </p>

      <p>The second most important thing you can do is <a href="https://www.change.org/p/city-of-winnipeg-council-be-heard-winnipeg-tell-your-councillor-that-we-need-a-fully-funded-infill-consultation">sign the petition on change.org.</a> Change.org will keep your information private - only your postal code and name will be shared</p>

      <h2>What is the Residential Infill Strategy?</h2>
      <p>The Residential Infill Strategy is an ongoing process where the City is designing guidelines for Infill development.</p>
      <p>Infill is development in older, existing neighbourhoods. It's different from greenfield development (surburban sprawl). </p>
      <p>In other words, <strong>infill is the alternative to suburban sprawl.</strong></p>
      <p>Early in 2019 there was a motion to fund the Residential Infill Strategy with a full, $650K budget. This would allow Winnipeg's Planning Department to hold thorough consultations with real dialogue between residents, builders and other stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Sadly, Winnipeg City Council DENIED this motion.</p>
      <p>We need you to speak up, <a href="/my-councillor.html">contact your councillor</a> and Mayor Bowman. Tell them the Residential Infill Strategy needs the full $650K.</p>
